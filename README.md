## Introduction

libzex is a (not yet functional) POSIX standards regexp matching library with some things that i have done for fun like my own parser and fuzzy search

A lot of this work is a rewrite of [TRE](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/) but made in zig for... well i wanted it :)

its just a study library for now, ifyou want a robust library use tre like GNU, dont trust in libzex for now!!
